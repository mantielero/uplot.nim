# Introduction
This library wraps javascript library [Î¼Plot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) in Nim. It is based on canvas so it is pretty fast (in my computer -an old i7 with Gb- handles pretty well more than 1 million points-).

This library enables plotting time series [like this](https://leeoniya.github.io/uPlot/demos/index.html).
